# Quant-Project-Option-Pricing-Implied-Volatility
Python project for pricing European options using the Black-Scholes formula. Includes simulated stock paths using geometric Brownian motion (GBM), vega-weighted implied volatility calculations from market data, and Monte-Carlo simulations visualising profit and loss.

# Quant Options Pricing & Simulation

## Motivation
I built this project to gain insight into how derivatives — specifically options — can be used to generate profits, while also gaining exposure to markets and applying Python to test strategies.

---

## Features
- **Pricing**: European call/put via Black–Scholes with continuous dividend yield `q`.
- **Implied Volatility**: Vega-weighted average IV, solved from market prices (Newton → Brent).
- **Market Data**: Live spot, strikes, expiries, and dividend yield via [yfinance](https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance).
- **Simulation**: Risk-neutral GBM paths (vectorized, Euler discretization).
- **PnL**: Multiple conventions — expiry, present value, and opportunity cost.
- **Plotting & Visualization**: 
  - Monte Carlo cumulative PnL for call and put options.
  - Histogram of terminal stock prices with fitted lognormal distribution and strike price marker.
  - Option payoff curves overlaid with simulated stock price distributions.
- **Codebase**: Modular, documented, and formatted (type hints, docstrings, Ruff/Black).

## Notes & Assumptions
- Risk-neutral drift uses `r - q` (risk-free rate minus dividend yield).
- Dividends are approximated from trailing payouts to estimate `q`.
- Model applies to **European options** (no early exercise).
- Implied volatility solver bounds are `(1e-9, 5.0)`; units are annualized decimal vols.
- Monte Carlo simulation uses daily steps (`N = 252`) over the option’s time to expiry.
  
## Planned Improvements
I plan to extend this project with:
- Fitting a full implied volatility surface across strikes and maturities.
- Adding option Greeks (delta, gamma, vega, theta, rho) and P&L sensitivities.
- Implementing delta-hedging and backtesting a simple strategy.
- Extending simulations to stochastic volatility models (e.g. Heston).
- Incorporating bid/ask spreads and transaction costs.
